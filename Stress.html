    <div class="container">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Stress is a common experience in today’s fast-paced world. While it is a normal response to challenging situations, chronic stress can negatively impact physical and mental health. Understanding stress, its causes, symptoms, and coping strategies is essential for managing it effectively.</p>

        <h2>What is Stress?</h2>
        <img src="assest/img/comfort mind/stress1.jpg" alt="Stress" class="img-left">
        <p>Stress is the body's reaction to any demand or challenge. It can be triggered by both positive and negative experiences. When faced with stress, the body produces hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, which prepare it to respond to the challenge (the "fight-or-flight" response).</p>

        <h2>Types of Stress</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Acute Stress:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Short-term Stress:</strong> This type of stress occurs in response to a specific event or situation, such as a job interview or an argument. It is temporary and usually resolves once the situation is over.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Episodic Acute Stress:</strong>

                    <li><strong>Long-term Stress:</strong> This type of stress occurs over a prolonged period and can result from ongoing situations like an unsatisfying job, financial problems, or relationship issues. Chronic stress can have severe health consequences if not managed properly.</li>
