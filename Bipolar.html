        <h2>Causes of Bipolar Disorder</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> Family history of bipolar disorder increases the risk, suggesting a genetic component.</li>
            <li><strong>Brain Structure and Function:</strong> Abnormalities in the structure and function of certain brain circuits may play a role.</li>
            <li><strong>Neurotransmitter Imbalance:</strong> Imbalances in brain chemicals (neurotransmitters) like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine may contribute to mood swings.</li>
            <li><strong>Environmental Factors:</strong> Stressful life events, trauma, and significant life changes can trigger mood episodes in individuals with a predisposition to the disorder.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Diagnosis and Treatment</h2>
        <p>Diagnosing bipolar disorder involves a thorough evaluation by a mental health professional, including a detailed medical history, symptom assessment, and sometimes physical and laboratory tests to rule out other conditions. Treatment options may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Medication:</strong>
                <ul>

                    <li>Antipsychotics: Used to treat mania and severe depression.</li>
                    <li>Antidepressants: May be prescribed for depressive episodes, often in combination with a mood stabilizer to prevent triggering mania.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Psychotherapy:</strong>
