            <li><strong>Schedule Self-Care:</strong> Treat self-care as an important appointment. Schedule it into your calendar and prioritize it just like any other commitment.</li>
            <li><strong>Be Consistent:</strong> Consistency is key to reaping the benefits of self-care. Aim to practice self-care regularly, even if it's just a few minutes each day.</li>
            <li><strong>Listen to Your Body:</strong> Pay attention to your body's signals and respond to its needs. Rest when you're tired, nourish yourself when you're hungry, and seek support when you need it.</li>
