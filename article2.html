        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common and serious mental health condition that affects parents after childbirth. It can significantly impact the well-being of parents and their ability to care for their newborn. Understanding postpartum depression is crucial for recognizing its symptoms, identifying potential causes, and exploring effective treatment options to support parents during this challenging period.</p>

        <p>Postpartum depression is a type of mood disorder that can affect parents (mothers and fathers) following childbirth. It typically develops within the first few weeks to months after delivery, although it can occur anytime during the first year postpartum. PPD is characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, anxiety, and exhaustion that interfere with daily functioning and bonding with the newborn.</p>
