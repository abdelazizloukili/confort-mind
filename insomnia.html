        <p>Insomnia is a common sleep disorder characterized by difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up too early and not being able to fall back asleep. It can significantly impact daily functioning, mood, and overall quality of life. Understanding insomnia is essential for recognizing its symptoms, identifying potential causes, and exploring effective treatment options.</p>

        <h2>What is Insomnia?</h2>
        <img src="assest/img/comfort mind/insonimia.jpg" alt="Insomnia" class="img-left">
        <p>Insomnia is a sleep disorder that involves persistent difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep. It can be acute (short-term) or chronic (long-lasting), and it may occur on its own or be linked to other medical or psychiatric conditions.</p>

        <h2>Symptoms of Insomnia</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Difficulty Falling Asleep: Spending a long time in bed trying to fall asleep.</li>
            <li>Frequent Awakening: Waking up often during the night and having trouble going back to sleep.</li>
            <li>Waking Up Too Early: Waking up earlier than desired and being unable to return to sleep.</li>
            <li>Non-Restorative Sleep: Feeling tired upon waking up, even after a full night's sleep.</li>
            <li>Daytime Impairment: Experiencing fatigue, mood disturbances, irritability, or difficulty concentrating during the day.</li>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Acute Insomnia:</strong> Brief episodes of difficulty sleeping, often triggered by stressful events or significant life changes. Acute insomnia typically resolves without treatment once the stressor is addressed.</li>
            <li><strong>Chronic Insomnia:</strong> Persistent sleep difficulties that occur at least three nights per week and last for three months or longer. Chronic insomnia may be caused by underlying medical, psychiatric, or sleep disorders.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Causes of Insomnia</h2>
        <p>Insomnia can result from various factors, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stress:</strong> Work, relationships, financial concerns, or major life events can trigger acute insomnia.</li>
            <li><strong>Poor Sleep Habits:</strong> Irregular sleep schedules, excessive napping, or using electronic devices before bedtime can disrupt sleep.</li>
            <li><strong>Medical Conditions:</strong> Chronic pain, respiratory disorders, gastrointestinal problems, or neurological conditions can interfere with sleep.</li>
            <li><strong>Mental Health Disorders:</strong> Anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or other psychiatric disorders can contribute to insomnia.</li>
            <li><strong>Medications:</strong> Certain medications, such as antidepressants, stimulants, and medications for asthma or hypertension, can disrupt sleep patterns.</li>
            <li><strong>Substance Use:</strong> Consumption of caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, or illicit drugs can affect sleep quality.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Diagnosis and Evaluation</h2>

            </li>
        </ul>
