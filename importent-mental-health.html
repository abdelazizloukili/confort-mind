            <li><strong>Impact on Physical Health:</strong> Mental health influences physical health outcomes, including susceptibility to chronic illnesses, recovery from illnesses, and overall longevity. For example, depression and anxiety can lead to chronic health conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and respiratory issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Mind-Body Connection:</strong> Emotional well-being can affect immune function, cardiovascular health, and the body's ability to heal and recover. Chronic stress can weaken the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to infections and illnesses.</li>

            <li><strong>Improved Relationships:</strong> Positive mental health supports healthy relationships with family, friends, and community members, enhancing social connections and support systems. Healthy relationships provide emotional support, reduce feelings of isolation, and contribute to overall happiness.</li>
            <li><strong>Personal Fulfillment:</strong> Promotes a sense of purpose, self-acceptance, and satisfaction in life, contributing to overall happiness and well-being. People with good mental health are more likely to pursue their goals and enjoy a fulfilling life.</li>
